CoRFu
=====


CoRFu is a framework for optimising the performance of magnetically confined fusion experiments.
CoRFu is portable and can be installed on most modern HPC systems.
The CoRFu package itself contains the optimisation driver, but is otherwise a thin wrapper
around the rest of the framework, most importantly CodeRunner and Trinity.

This page is currently under construction. CoRFu is fully operational, but not yet 
packaged and released.  


== Contributing to corfu
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
